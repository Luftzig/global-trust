* Global Trust Project
#:Author: Yoav Luft

** Preface and initialisms

WVS - World Values Survey, refers to data regarding questions of trust in different countries.

** Goals
Two show the relation between conditions of living: poverty, education, violence, corruption, inequality; and confidence in various
institutions: Churches, Armed Forces, The Press, The Police, The Government, The Parliament

** Methods
The data is multidimensional, and has several aggregates. I've aggregated data from gapminder by mean value corrosponding
to WVS periods: Wave 4 - 1999-2004 (WVS not included), Wave 5 - 2005-2009, Wave 6 - 2010-2014, Wave 7 - 2015-2019 (not published).
From early explorations of the raw data it seems like gapminder data is strongly corrolated between adjacent years, which
is why I consider these aggregations to be good approximations.

I'll use a combinations of several methods: scatter matrix for comparing data series, categories and node data to display
low level information (size of point correlates to GDP, GINI index, etc.) and colour coding of countries.

For displaying different times, I will use an adaption of Time Curves

One problem I have is that WVS has at most two points in time. But I would like to explore whether trends are predictive.

*** Data Processing
Data from WVS was downloaded as R workspaces, and imported into a Pandas Dataframe using appropriate libraries.
Data about the year in which each country was sample in a wave was taken from website directly. Codings were also taken from the
website.
Data from gapminder was downloaded manually.
For the WVS data set, after selecting the columns of interest and mapping missing values and country codes to names, I had extracted
only the countries that appear both in wave 5 and wave 6. Of these, I only took these that had data for all questions, narrowing down
the selection to 32 countries.
As for gap minder, I narrowed the data to countries that appear in all datasets, to years 1999-2020 and finally I only took the 
countries that also appear in WVS dataset (after some manual renaming of entries), leaving 31 countries.


** About text

Global Trust is a work of information visualization which attempts to explore the relations
between indicators of economic development and the feeling of trust and confidence that people feel in different
countries overtime.

Created by Yoav Luft for KTH course "Information Visualization", 2020.

Discovery process

In the initial discovery process I wanted to explore the question "Does immigration affects the values of a country".
I started by exploring both data sets, World Values Survery (WVS) and Gapminder (GM). This initial exploration brought
up two problems: (A) WVS has a lot of data, so comparing values of two countries will require dimensionality reduction
of some sort; (B) GM has no data about immigration, only about refugees.

Discovery, Take II

My second attempt at discovery was around the question "What influences the trust people give in each other and in
public entities?". To answer that question, I've explored WVS dataset and found 6 questions regarding trust and 12
questions regarding confidence in organizations. I've decided to look at the following possible influences: economic
issues, violence and corruption. I found 5 GM datasets that are relevant.

Next, I explored the datasets using Pandas, and plot several relationships. I've also considered the question of
temporality: WVS data is divided to 4 year waves, while GM is annual. Fig 1. shows exploration of the impact of
aggregating GM time series to chunks corresponding to waves.

After some research, I decided to approach the question of displaying temporal relationships by using a method inspired
by Time-Curves [Bach et al. 2015]. But in my case I had to deal with holes in the data: For every country and WVS
question, I had only two points of data, but for GM I had many. I decided to interpolate the data between points for
which there is both WVS and GM data, and extrapolate based on GM for years outside WVS samples. Fig. 2 and 3 shows
explorations of displaying data from two dimensions + time, and for using time-curves inspired design.

Learnings

I can divide my learnings into several aspects: Technically, I've learned to use elm-visualization, and I'm more strongly
convinced now that Elm is the best thing for the web, ever, although it is still young and not as feature rich as other
frameworks. On the visualization side, I had explored several ideas for connecting multi-dimensional data and time,
but I would have liked to explore more. On the data side, I did not come into any conclusions. There seems to be, for
example, some relation between corruption and lack of trust, but corruption didn't seem to influence confidence in the
government. If I had the time, I would have wanted to explore more relationships, maybe through scatter-plot matrices,
or user defined aggregations.
